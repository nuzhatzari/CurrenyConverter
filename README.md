IV. Which architecture would you use for the required task below? Why?

Ans. I have used VIPER architecture in the above sample because it simplifies complex projects and it was descriped in the task that this currency converter is a component is a large-scaled project.
This architecture sets clear responsibilities for each module, and is good while working in a large team because multiple developers can work simultaneously.

Note: I have not used fixer.io api because the free version has restricted access.
